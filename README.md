# ChemBERTa Regression Project

This project implements a regression model using ChemBERTa to predict pIC50 values from molecular representations. The model leverages embeddings extracted from molecular structures represented in SMILES format.

```

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Data**: Use the `data_loader.py` to load the dataset and convert RDKit objects to SMILES.
2. **Train the Model**: Run the `train.py` script to train the regression model on the dataset.
3. **Evaluate the Model**: The training script will also evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error and R².

## Features

- **ChemBERTa Embeddings**: Extract embeddings from SMILES strings using the `seyonec/ChemBERTa-zinc-base-v1` model.
- **Regression Model**: Train a PyTorch-based regression model (`SimpleRegressor`) to predict pIC50 values.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, convert SMILES to RDKit objects, and standardize molecular representations.
- **Metrics**: Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² (coefficient of determination).
- **GPU Support**: Leverage GPU acceleration for faster training and inference.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Use Weights & Biases (wandb) to log training loss, test metrics, and hyperparameters.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python packages:

- pandas
- RDKit
- transformers
- torch
- scikit-learn
- wandb

## Results

- The embeddings generated by ChemBERTa are saved in a CSV file (`chemberta_embeddings.csv`) to avoid recalculating them for future runs.
- The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like MSE and R², which are logged for each epoch.
